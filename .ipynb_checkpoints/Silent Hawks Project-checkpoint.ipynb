    "Our project is focusing on analyzing the crime in Chicago. The City of Chicago maintains a database of the crimes committed in Chicago since 2001. This database has one table which is crimes committed and has many different properties that we can use in our analysis. Examples include case number, date, block, IUCR code, primary type, description, location description, whether an arrest was made, etc. \n",

    "The data source is a CSV file and since this data source is around 1.7 GB so therefore we will not include it in the github repo due to file size constraints. The link will be provided in the readme. \n",
